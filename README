FastTaskAsk – dead simple timetracking
══════════════════════════════════════

This is a _really_ simple timetracking script:

 1. Launch it.
 2. It will ask you for a description of what you’re doing. Enter one, or
    leave the field blank.
 3. It will append a line containing date and time of when you started it plus
    the description you’ve entered to ~/fasttaskask.txt.

If you don’t enter anything, the description in the file will be blank.

Note that date and time of you _starting_ FastTaskAsk will be written. That
means that you can launch it as soon as the phone rings, but don’t have to enter
a description yet. Just leave the window open until after the call, enter a
description then, and hit OK.

You can use a tool like BetterTouchTool <http://www.boastr.de/> to bind FTA to a
hotkey or something like that.
